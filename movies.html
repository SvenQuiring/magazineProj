                                It's a movie that its extremely gore it is the continuation of the last movie. Where a crazy doctor drugs people and puts them in traps. They have to sacrifice a part of his body to escape alive. It's a rare idea but creative too!
                                In this movie, the special effects were completely perfect. The history, again, it's perfect for the scenarios. All characters are used in the movie and it has a very camera work. All the time is showing what you need to know.
                                 I love saw endings because they make you see that all the time you had the solution in front of you. But your instincts made you act as you are.

                                I recently saw the film "Bad Boys For Life" directed by Bilall Fallah and Adilel Arbi. It is about two ex-policemen, Mike and Marcus, played by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. They returned to patrol and they had to catch a drug dealer. 
                                I liked that the film has funny and action scenes.
                                The story was quite good, what I liked most was the end.
                                The acting was so good and the special effects were excellent.
                                All in all, the film was really funny. If you like comedy and action, you have to see it yes or yes.

                                Parasite is one of the most glorious films I had ever seen not only because of the fantastic story that has this film but for the absolutely amazing cast performance. The film is about the story of a poor family that cheats a rich family to get jobs that were very well paid.
                                The casting of this film was extremely good and if you saw it you will trust me that this is in the top 10 films of history. If I had to say something I didn't like about this film I think I will not find mistakes in this piece of art.
                                All in all, the. The movie is really good and i recommend watching it at least one time to see the amazing story of this film.

                                Some time ago I watched the film “Me before you”, directed by Thea Sharrock, with Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, and Matthew Lewis.
                                It was about the life of Louisa Clark, a happy and kind girl who goes from job to job to help her family. It changes completely when she starts working as a caregiver for a young millionaire, who was paralyzed after an accident. Slowly they start to have a big connection but everything changes when she found out that he wanted to kill himself because of his paralysis.
                               What I really like was that they fell in love in an amazing way and they were really nice together but then she couldn’t convince him not to kill himself so I felt really sad. But de graphics, the acting, the camera work, and the music were amazing.
                               In conclusion, the film is great, but I don’t recommend you to watch it if you don’t wanna cry.

                                I have recently seen the film "Parents trap" directed by Nancy Meyers, with Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Simon Kunz, Natasha Richardson, and more. It was about some twins who don't know of each other, until one day that they met in a camp, and after that, they start trying to achieve their parent's reconciliation.
                                I really like the film, it was utterly exciting. Everything was completely good, the camera work, the music, the photography, and all the actors were totally nice.
                                All in all, it is absolutely amazing. I would recommend this film, it is really interesting, and very nice too see in the family.

                                I saw the film "The intern", a comedy film directed by Nancy Meyers. It was about a widower 70 years old man called Ben Whittaker (played by Robert De Niro), that after retiring, he started working in an online business dedicated to fashion. When he started working there as an intern, he began an essential person and very loved by his companions including Jules (played by Anne Hathaway) his boss, who objected to hiring him because of his age.
                                The camera work was pretty good. And the actors were really amazing. I think that the ending was a little bit confusing but still understand.
                                I would recommend it because I think it is a good movie to spend time with the family and watch it all together.

                                Coraline is a 2009 American stop-motion animated, fantasy, and horror film directed and written for the screen by Henry Selick Based on the 2002 Novella of Coraline by Neil Gaiman.
                                Produced by Laika, and the person who voices the main character is Dakota Fanning.
                                It was about an adventurous girl named Coraline that found a secret door in the wall of her new home that she doesn't like cause her neighbors and cause her parents didn't Pay attention to her, but the house could be dangerous because it keeps a dark secret.
                                I thought that it was scary and the first time that I saw it I screamed a Lot.
                                I enjoyed how mysterious it was and how she was solving the puzzles. I liked the film. Its beginning was like the witch assembling a doll with which she would later spy Coraline for knowing how to take her to that "world". And its ending was like she had fun on a spring party with her neighbors and parents.
                                And in all, I was intrigued and surprised.
                                I would recommend it to watch it with your family cause it's so funny and good for having a good Netflix night excluding the age.
