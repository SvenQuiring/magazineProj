                        Insatiable focuses on the revenge of the protagonist, Patty, towards those who have ever made her feel bad because of her weight. Suddenly, the young woman becomes thin and slender, which changes the perception of people towards her. But, Patty does not forget or forgive her and wants to take justice into her own hands. To do this, hire a disgraced and dissatisfied civil lawyer who has become an expert beauty coach. This lawyer, Bob, sees great potential in the teenager and, with the help of his wife, introduces her to the world of beauty pageants. Patty wants to go much further than Bob and his wife thought.

                        2.	<b>The Big Bang Theory:</b><br>
                        What at first seemed like a fresh series that would address the point of view of the most rejected, turned out to be a mockery of viewers. Always accompanied by recorded laughter, without which her jokes would lose effect, her characters are artificial parodies of individuals that writers do not really know. Despite the fact that they integrate cunning jokes created by scientists, it seems that the scripts favor easy laughs using simple references, which are often meaningless, and forget about congruent stories that provoke emotions in the audience. It is an extremely superficial series that, unlike its predecessors, fails to offer a clear development of each of the protagonists and only inserts them in different unreal situations that follow the stereotypes that many sit-coms try to avoid today .

                        3.	<b>Two and a Half Men:</b><br>
                        Sexist, politically incorrect, and just plain crude, Two and a Half Men was the last breath of a dreamy generation who thought that happiness lay in sex and money. The show was intended to show male duality in front of a small boy and managed to create good episodes in the beginning, however, he eventually opted for the simple humor that resembled watching a "green-tailed" man expel speeches about a mindset that simply no longer exists. Also, although the characters seem to undergo different changes, the narrative lacks consistency by giving them a clear evolution. Needless to say, when Charlie Sheen and Angus T. Young (who also pointed out how bad the series was in both structure and subject matter) went missing despite the efforts of Jon Cryer and Ashton Kutcher, the series went from irrelevant to being simply unbearable.

                        4.	<b>CSI:</b><br>
                        We can say many good things about CSI in any of its presentations, however, it is overshadowed by its extreme simplicity and indifference to the detail or relevance of its episodes. Although he uses good stories sometimes, the fact that detectives, forensic doctors and scientists have access to technologies that are impossible or too far from reality, makes him absurd without intending to be. In these works that do not really seek recognition, but only entertain, it is difficult to create a criticism, however, with the superior series that are produced today, it is difficult for people to choose to look at such a predictable work with cliche moments, reactions exaggerated and plots that, in the long run, are meaningless.

                        5.	<b>Law and Order: SVU</b><br>
                        Like CSI, Law and Order in any of its presentations has a similar format that becomes boring and predictable quickly. All the episodes focus on a specific hunt that seems to be fruitless and in the end, whether for better or for worse, the situation is resolved. The problem is that, unlike Dr. House, who used the same method, these programs lack the ability to give logical and concise backgrounds to their characters, in addition to sometimes their plots are more exaggerated than the real cases in those who are inspired. However, those weaknesses are the fault of the writers. As we mentioned, these shows are made to entertain, so they are not so focused on detail. So if someone is looking for something deeper or smarter, they should see more options.

                        6.	<b>The Middle:</b><br>
                        The Middle was an attempt by Malcolm in the Middle but with stranger and unfamiliar features. Lacking genuinely friendly or identifiable characters, she had to rely on their quirks to be recognizable and was ultimately lost in oblivion. Although it has moments of good laughs that many times criticize middle-class people, it is too plastic to feel identified, and it seems more like a work thought by Seth MacFarlane of Family Guy than anything else.

                        Laughter recorded in banal jokes, relationships that do not match and a plot that lasted too long were the downfall of How I Met Your Mother, a series that began as a whirlwind, making millions laugh with its quirks and fresh young adult humor, and It ended up being a parody of itself and ending in one of the worst notes in television history, which showed that, for at least four years, the play had stopped being good. Sure, many love HIMYM, but the truth is that it was more the closeness with the characters that made us see it than the weak stories that appeared in each episode.

                        8.	<b>Sex and the City:</b><br>
                        We still can't believe the success of Sex & the City. It is a series aimed exclusively at upper-middle-class women, with insignificant problems that seem to affect their lives more than a famine, who are convinced that sex and misunderstood feminism are the only things that give meaning to their lives. This failure of revolutionary comedy could be funny at times and at times delves into the psychology of its protagonists, but everything is extremely superficial. What is seen on the screen are privileged individuals who for the first time seem to face existentialism and the insignificance of their plastic life. There is not much behind.

                        9.	<b>Glee:</b><br>
                        Never did superficial melodrama seem so absurd until Glee arrived. Inspired by the High School Musical generation, this work wanted to bring the musicals to television and succeeded ... with extremely forced scripts that only existed so that the boys could sing a hit at the end of the episode. There are some salvageable things; the performances, the good direction in the moments of action, however, all that is diminished when noticing the weak relationships between the characters (who are less than not very memorable) and the cliché style of adolescent soap operas.

                        What was once gold is now a complete disaster. Steven Moffat has become known for creating great jobs and destroying them by trying to make them more interesting. Sherlock's magic, which mixed mystery, detective work, and an exaggerated - but entertaining - version of the genius' mind disappeared once Moriarty left the plane. The story became weak, the protagonist's interpersonal relationships became a recurring joke and the personality that defined him disappeared between a cloud of forced haughtiness, little credible psychological problems and plots that lead nowhere. What we love so much has once gone and most likely will never come back.

                        Netflix immerses us in a drama that completely hits today's young society, in which it deals with all the conflicts they face: bullying or machismo. As well as the social and diversity issues regarding love or homosexuality, treated in a natural way. All of them are rounded off with an almost taboo theme such as suicide, the main protagonist with a strong emotional dose in the form of a tape.
                        One day Clay Jensen, one of these teenagers, arrives at his house when he finds a mysterious shoe box with no return address. Intrigued, he decides to open it and finds a series of cassette tapes, apparently recorded by Hannah Baker, a classmate who committed suicide two weeks earlier.
                        Hannah chose 13 companions to tell her story, the 13 whom she blames for what happened. Thanks to instructions he left in the box, the tapes should reach all of them so that they would hear a truth that no one wants to hear: the thirteen reasons why he decided to kill himself.

                        The Elite Way School is an internationally prestigious private secondary school that has very demanding regulations. The students at this school are, for the most part, from the richest families in the country. Others, however, are scholars who are also discriminated against by the richest.
