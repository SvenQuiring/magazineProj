                            "Digital citizenship" is a concept that is in permanent construction and that refers 
                            mainly to our behaviors and attitudes in digital spaces, and at the same time to our 
                            rights and obligations.
                            <br><br>
                            “Digital citizenship is a set of competencies that empowers citizens to access, 
                            retrieve, understand, evaluate and use, to create, as well as share information and 
                            media content in all formats, using various tools, in a critical way, ethical and 
                            effective in order to participate and engage in personal, professional and social 
                            activities ”. UNESCO

                            "Building citizenship in digital environments" is a joint effort of a system that 
                            includes the State, academia, companies, organized civil society, as well as each 
                            of us who are part of society from the different roles we occupy.
                            <br><br>
                            The equitable development of our society implies considering digital citizenship 
                            as a central component for the exercise of SXXI citizenship. It implies the 
                            development of skills that allow critical assumption of the information received 
                            from the media, an understanding of the social and economic impact of technology, 
                            respect for the laws; and the knowledge, mobilization and defense of their own 
                            rights in a digital environment.

                            Based on the recognition of this situation, we considered it necessary to develop 
                            joint work with different organizations and institutions related to the issue and 
                            agree on common reference frameworks on Digital Citizenship, which allow us to 
                            generate coordinated and aligned awareness strategies.

                            This group has worked on the development of a series of agreements that include the

                            critical spirit, fake news, coexistence, rules for the use of devices, security, trust and privacy, 
                            reflection on the terms and conditions that are required for the use of applications, the 
                            main lines to be developed in education, among others.
