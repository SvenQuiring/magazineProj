                        E3 is one of the most important events in the world, where the various videogame companies 
                        announce their next releases and the new consoles andcomponents that will hit the market. 
                        But with great regret this E3 2020 is canceled due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19. 
                        Although we can still see the launches and announcements on the different websites, it does 
                        not compare to this annual event where a large group of people with the same great love 
                        for video games come together andinteract.

                        Counter-Strike Global Offensive, it´s a team-based, first-person shooter videogame, 
                        this game has two main events every year, the Majors. These events are viewed by millions 
                        of people over the world. This year there was going to be a major on Río, Brazil on May, 
                        however, it has just been rescheduled to November due to the Covid-19 outbreak, 
                        because of this the second Major of the year has been canceled, and so the prize pool 
                        of this Major will be rising to $2.000.000 USD, the biggest prize of all the Majors yet. 
                        The developers of the game have said that they took this rough decision-taking health and 
                        security as priorities, and because of the risk ofa live event, mostly on Brazil, 
                        which is the country of South America with the most cases of this new Coronavirus, there 
                        was no way that this event could take place at the moment.
