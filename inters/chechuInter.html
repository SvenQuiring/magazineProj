                        1-How are you coping with the online classes?<br>
                        It is definitive been a challenge because you need to be very flexible and able to adapt to a 
                        lot of things, I actually participate in a lot of webinars to be updated on some tool that 
                        we can use with the students, so I would say that I am coping rather well.<br>
                        <br>
                        2-Was it difficult or not?<br>
                        In steed of difficult, when there is a problem, I would always see an opportunity, 
                        its been a huge opportunity for me to leer a lot of new thing, because you know that 
                        in the English area we have been using platforms for a wile, but in this year in 
                        particular at one point we had to do a 100% online teaching and it was really challenging, 
                        so more than problematic it was challenging.<br>
                        <br>
                        3-How did students react?<br>
                        We had a variety of answers, there were some students that adapted very quickly because luckily 
                        we have the millennial so they are very the screen type people, but there were some people the 
                        founded it difficult because they were used to having the teacher there and asking questions 
                        every five minutes which is logical but since we had the virtual environment it was difficult, 
                        but we tried our best.<br>
                        <br>
                        4-What was the most difficult part of teaching online?<br>
                        Connectivity, because form both sides is was very difficult, especially when it was raining and 
                        stuff like that, so me or the students would have a very bad connection, and when there were 
                        blackout there were no computers, it was crazy, but other than that I would say that was the mayor 
                        problem.<br>
                        <br>
                        5-How do you fell about yours students, do you feel they learn what you wanted?<br>
                        Absolutely confident that even on the fact that was online we had done a lot of thing, especially 
                        whit my private students, we did a lot of challenges and projects and stuff, and I can see that they 
                        are making progress.<br>
                        <br>
                        6-Do you feel like you could teach as you planned ?<br>
                        No, definitive I have to say that we should do mayor replanting, we had to made a lot of adjustments, 
                        priorities some areas because it was easier to do those online. So what we planned on February, be always 
                        have to change it regales of the pandemic, but this year in particular we had to made a lot of changes, 
                        but I am more than happy of how it has turn down.  <br>
