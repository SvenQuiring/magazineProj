                        1-How are you coping with the online classes?<br>
                        Good good, at first i didn’t find easy to get used to it because i started with blackboards but 
                        then i realised that the quality of the camera wasn’t good so i started using digital tablets, that 
                        make things easier, and then i coped very well with online classes<br>
                        <br>
                        2-Was it difficult or not?<br>
                        I didn’t find it difficult, i found it different, a challenge
                        The most difficult part was not being able to see the students’ faces, their copybooks and the 
                        way they were working. I had to trust a lot in what they say they were doing and not in what i was 
                        able to see<br>
                        <br>
                        3-How did students react?<br>
                        On the first week of quarantine i started to organize all this stuff to start with online 
                        classes and because of the fact that i started earlier with the organization, i was one of the 
                        first teachers to start with this kind of classes. And then, other of the most difficult parts 
                        was de evaluation, i didn’t know how to evaluate students and i continue with some doubts because 
                        i don’t know how to know if they really understood a concept or they are looking it on internet 
                        or with a partner<br>
                        <br>
                        4-What was the most difficult part of teaching online?<br>
                        They reacted very well, if they didn’t lie to me of course. They all say they understood things 
                        in the online classes, i don’t know if they’re lying but i trust they aren’t.<br>
                        <br>
                        5-How do you fell about yours students, do you feel they learn what you wanted?<br> 
                        I trust them, i liked the way online classes were but all students participate. I still have 
                        to evaluate if they really understood what i taught, that is my big doubt. They say that they 
                        understood all but i have my doubts and i want to make sure they understood.<br>
                        <br>
                        6-Do you fell like you could teach as you planned ?<br>
                        No, when a started with online classes i skipped some topics, it doesn't mean i’m not going to 
                        teach them, i’m going to teach them later. I have to change the topics’ order. But i’m going to 
                        teach the same topics that i was going to teach in face to face classes<br>
