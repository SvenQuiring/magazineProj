                        1-How are you coping with the online classes?<br>
                        Great. There was an important learning curve, especially with the digitalization and explanation 
                        of the new and different subjects..<br>
                        <br>
                        2-Was it difficult or not?<br>
                        As a start, yes. But the knowledge will stay forever<br>
                        <br>
                        3-What was the most difficult part of teaching online?<br>
                        The interaction. There was no interaction with the student. It was pretty hard for one to say 
                        “I didn’t understand something.” and to then try and explain it to him.<br>
                        <br>
                        4-How did you get used to computer teaching?<br>
                        Yes, yes because I already had experience with them.<br>
                        <br>
                        5-How did students react?<br>
                        There were a lot more insecurities in the beginning, but everyone got used to it till it finally reached 
                        a point where the development of a class was comfortable.<br>
                        <br>
                        6-How do you feel about your students?<br>
                        Luckily, it surpassed any expectative that I had.<br>
                        <br>
                        7-Do you fell like you could teach as you planned ?<br>
                        It took some time, but at the end, yes.<br>
