                        1-How are you coping with the online classes?<br>
                        At first was complicated, because the absence of this new form of work, but then I 
                        can adapt to this form.<br>
                        <br>
                        2-Was it difficult or not?<br>
                        I thought it was going to be more difficult, at first teachers can be scared because 
                        its something new and we never tried it, but for me at the end it was not as difficult as I thought, 
                        it was very practical.<br>
                        <br>
                        3-What was the most difficult part of teaching online?<br>
                        It wasn't hard, but with big groups you lose the dialogue, interaccion and the students maybe 
                        aren't focused in the class like in the presencial class.<br>
                        <br>
                        4-What do you think about online clases?<br>
                        Normal, I liked it, it surprised me, because I didn't have the opportunity to improve myself 
                        in technology like my students, everything cost me a little more but finally it was comforting.<br>
                        <br>
                        5-How did the students react?<br>
                        Commitment, its the word that defines the reaction of my students, like, I have doubts about me, 
                        also I have doubts about my students, but at the end I can only congratulate them.<br>
                        <br>
                        6-How do you feel about your students, do you feel they learnt what you wanted?<br>
                        I felt worried about what I think the students and I investigate, I can differentiate the 
                        attitude of the students in home and the students in the high school.<br>
                        <br>
                        7-Do you feel like you could teach as you planned?<br>
                        Really the conclusion is the same, this things depends of the teacher but,  I can't 
                        compare the videoclass with the presentiality. I thought that it was going to be difficult 
                        but at the end it wasn't, now I value the face to face and the video call class.<br>
