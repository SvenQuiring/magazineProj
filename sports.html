                        2021. The Minster of Japan confirmed this in a
                        conference realized this Tuesday. This was done
                        because of the propagation of Covid-19 in the last
                        months. Abe stand out with the media that he asked
                        Bach to take the final decision and the Olympic
                        committee accepted the postponement of the games.
                        Some countries like Canada said that if the games
                        were made in 2020 they will not send their athletes
                        to be part of the Olympic Games.
                        United States support the idea of the postponement
                        of the games because of the propagation of
                        Coronavirus.
                        While the Olympics have been canceled in the past,
                        because of World War I and World War II, they have
                        never been postponed to a different year.</p>
